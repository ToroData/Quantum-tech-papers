"A Grand Unification of Quantum Algorithms - John M. Martyn, Zane M. Rossi, Andrew K. Tan, Isaac L. Chuang",https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02859,,A Grand Unification of Quantum Algorithms,"Quantum algorithms offer significant speedups over their classical
counterparts for a variety of problems. The strongest arguments for this
advantage are borne by algorithms for quantum search, quantum phase estimation,
and Hamiltonian simulation, which appear as subroutines for large families of
composite quantum algorithms. A number of these quantum algorithms were
recently tied together by a novel technique known as the quantum singular value
transformation (QSVT), which enables one to perform a polynomial transformation
of the singular values of a linear operator embedded in a unitary matrix. In
the seminal GSLW'19 paper on QSVT [Gily\'en, Su, Low, and Wiebe, ACM STOC
2019], many algorithms are encompassed, including amplitude amplification,
methods for the quantum linear systems problem, and quantum simulation. Here,
we provide a pedagogical tutorial through these developments, first
illustrating how quantum signal processing may be generalized to the quantum
eigenvalue transform, from which QSVT naturally emerges. Paralleling GSLW'19,
we then employ QSVT to construct intuitive quantum algorithms for search, phase
estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, and also showcase algorithms for the
eigenvalue threshold problem and matrix inversion. This overview illustrates
how QSVT is a single framework comprising the three major quantum algorithms,
thus suggesting a grand unification of quantum algorithms.","John M. Martyn, Zane M. Rossi, Andrew K. Tan, Isaac L. Chuang",arXiv,quant-ph,"john_m._martyn andrew_k._tan isaac_l._chuang a grand unification of_quantum algorithms - john m. martyn , zane m. rossi , andrew k. tan , isaac l. chuang"
A photonic cluster state machine gun,https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2587,Quantum Photonics,A photonic cluster state machine gun,"We present a method to convert certain single photon sources into devices
capable of emitting large strings of photonic cluster state in a controlled and
pulsed ""on demand"" manner. Such sources would greatly reduce the resources
required to achieve linear optical quantum computation. Standard spin errors,
such as dephasing, are shown to affect only 1 or 2 of the emitted photons at a
time. This allows for the use of standard fault tolerance techniques, and shows
that the photonic machine gun can be fired for arbitrarily long times. Using
realistic parameters for current quantum dot sources, we conclude high
entangled-photon emission rates are achievable, with Pauli-error rates per
photon of less than 0.2%. For quantum dot sources the method has the added
advantage of alleviating the problematic issues of obtaining identical photons
from independent, non-identical quantum dots, and of exciton dephasing.","Netanel H. Lindner, Terry Rudolph",arXiv,"quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall",a photonic cluster state machine gun
"A quantum walk control plane for distributed quantum computing in quantum networks - Matheus Guedes de Andrade, Wenhan Dai, Saikat Guha, Don Towsley",https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09839,,"A quantum walk control plane for distributed quantum computing in
  quantum networks","Quantum networks are complex systems formed by the interaction among quantum
processors through quantum channels. Analogous to classical computer networks,
quantum networks allow for the distribution of quantum computation among
quantum computers. In this work, we describe a quantum walk protocol to perform
distributed quantum computing in a quantum network. The protocol uses a quantum
walk as a quantum control signal to perform distributed quantum operations. We
consider a generalization of the discrete-time coined quantum walk model that
accounts for the interaction between a quantum walker system in the network
graph with quantum registers inside the network nodes. The protocol logically
captures distributed quantum computing, abstracting hardware implementation and
the transmission of quantum information through channels. Control signal
transmission is mapped to the propagation of the walker system across the
network, while interactions between the control layer and the quantum registers
are embedded into the application of coin operators. We demonstrate how to use
the quantum walker system to perform a distributed CNOT operation, which shows
the universality of the protocol for distributed quantum computing.
Furthermore, we apply the protocol to the task of entanglement distribution in
a quantum network.","Matheus Guedes de Andrade, Wenhan Dai, Saikat Guha, Don Towsley",arXiv,quant-ph,"wenhan_dai don_towsley a quantum walk control plane for distributed_quantum computing in_quantum networks_- matheus guedes de andrade , wenhan dai , saikat guha , don towsley"

losses, robust quantum communication over long lossy channels requires quantum
repeaters. It is widely believed that a necessary and highly demanding
requirement for quantum repeaters is the existence of matter quantum memories
at the repeater nodes. Here we show that such a requirement is, in fact,
unnecessary by introducing the concept of all photonic quantum repeaters based
on flying qubits. As an example of the realization of this concept, we present
a protocol based on photonic cluster state machine guns and a loss-tolerant
measurement equipped with local high-speed active feedforwards. We show that,
with such an all photonic quantum repeater, the communication efficiency still
scales polynomially with the channel distance. Our result paves a new route

"An Architecture for Meeting Quality-of-Service Requirements in Multi-User Quantum Networks - Matthew Skrzypczyk, Stephanie Wehner",https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13124,,"An Architecture for Meeting Quality-of-Service Requirements in
  Multi-User Quantum Networks","Quantum communication can enhance internet technology by enabling novel
applications that are provably impossible classically. The successful execution
of such applications relies on the generation of quantum entanglement between
different users of the network which meets stringent performance requirements.
Alongside traditional metrics such as throughput and jitter, one must ensure
the generated entanglement is of sufficiently high quality. Meeting such
performance requirements demands a careful orchestration of many devices in the
network, giving rise to a fundamentally new scheduling problem. Furthermore,
technological limitations of near-term quantum devices impose significant
constraints on scheduling methods hoping to meet performance requirements. In
this work, we propose the first end-to-end design of a centralized quantum
network with multiple users that orchestrates the delivery of entanglement
which meets quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of applications. We achieve
this by using a centrally constructed schedule that manages usage of devices
and ensures the coordinated execution of different quantum operations
throughout the network. We use periodic task scheduling and
resource-constrained project scheduling techniques, including a novel
heuristic, to construct the schedules. Our simulations of four small networks
using hardware-validated network parameters, and of a real-world fiber topology
using futuristic parameters, illustrate trade-offs between traditional and

architecture has been presented so far that exploits both the advantages of
qubits encoded into states of light and the modern tools for their generation.

Central to our architecture is the generation and manipulation of
three-dimensional hybrid resource states comprising both bosonic qubits and
squeezed vacuum states. The proposal enables exploiting state-of-the-art
procedures for the non-deterministic generation of bosonic qubits combined with
the strengths of continuous-variable quantum computation, namely the
implementation of Clifford gates using easy-to-generate squeezed states.
Moreover, the architecture is based on two-dimensional integrated photonic
chips used to produce a qubit cluster state in one temporal and two spatial
dimensions. By reducing the experimental challenges as compared to existing
architectures and by enabling room-temperature quantum computation, our design
opens the door to scalable fabrication and operation, which may allow photonics

homogenizer, whose convergence properties model a thermalization process. In
the original quantum homogenizer protocol, a system qubit converges to the
state of identical reservoir qubits through partial-swap interactions, that
allow interference between reservoir qubits. We design an alternative,
incoherent quantum homogenizer, where each system-reservoir interaction is
moderated by a control qubit using a controlled-swap interaction. We show that
our incoherent homogenizer satisfies the essential conditions for
homogenization, being able to transform a qubit from any state to any other
state to arbitrary accuracy, with negligible impact on the reservoir qubits'
states. Our results show that the convergence properties of homogenization
machines that are important for modelling thermalization are not dependent on
coherence between qubits in the homogenization protocol. We then derive bounds
on the resources required to re-use the homogenizers for performing state
transformations. This demonstrates that both homogenizers are universal for any
number of homogenizations, for an increased resource cost.","Anna Beever, Maria Violaris, Chiara Marletto, Vlatko Vedral",arXiv,quant-ph,"maria_violaris comparing coherent and incoherent models for_quantum homogenization - anna beever , maria violaris , chiara_marletto , and vlatko_vedral"

Constructor Theory of Life - Chiara Marletto,https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0681,,Constructor Theory of Life,"Neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory explains how the appearance of purposive
design in the sophisticated adaptations of living organisms can have come about
without their intentionally being designed. The explanation relies crucially on
the possibility of certain physical processes: mainly, gene replication and
natural selection. In this paper I show that for those processes to be possible
without the design of biological adaptations being encoded in the laws of
physics, those laws must have certain other properties. The theory of what
these properties are is not part of evolution theory proper, and has not been
developed, yet without it the neo-Darwinian theory does not fully achieve its
purpose of explaining the appearance of design. To this end I apply Constructor
Theory's new mode of explanation to provide an exact formulation of the
appearance of design, of no-design laws, and of the logic of self-reproduction
and natural selection, within fundamental physics. I conclude that
self-reproduction, replication and natural selection are possible under
no-design laws, the only non-trivial condition being that they allow digital
information to be physically instantiated. This has an exact characterisation
in the constructor theory of information. I also show that under no-design laws

so-called 'decision-theoretic approach' (Deutsch, 1999; Wallace, 2003, 2007,
2012), I shall recast that problem in the recently proposed constructor theory
of information - where quantum theory is represented as one of a class of
superinformation theories, which are local, non-probabilistic theories
conforming to certain constructor-theoretic conditions. I prove that the
unpredictability of measurement outcomes (to which I give an exact meaning via
constructor theory), necessarily arises in superinformation theories. Then I
explain how the appearance of stochasticity in (finitely many) repeated
measurements can arise under superinformation theories. And I establish
sufficient conditions for a superinformation theory to inform decisions (made
under it) as if it were probabilistic, via a Deutsch-Wallace-type argument -
thus defining a class of decision-supporting superinformation theories. This
broadens the domain of applicability of that argument to cover

consistent with the laws of motion for finite systems only in certain
approximations, which improve with increasing scale, given various assumptions
about initial conditions which are neither specified precisely nor even thought
to hold exactly in nature. Here I propose a new formulation of the zeroth,
first and second laws, improving upon the axiomatic approach to thermodynamics
(Carath\'eodory, 1909; Lieb & Yngvason, 1999), via the principles of the

plateau phenomenon. In this perspective article, we face the increasingly loud
elephant in the room and ask a question that has been hinted at by many but not
explicitly addressed: Can the structure that allows one to avoid barren
plateaus also be leveraged to efficiently simulate the loss classically? We
present strong evidence that commonly used models with provable absence of
barren plateaus are also classically simulable, provided that one can collect
some classical data from quantum devices during an initial data acquisition
phase. This follows from the observation that barren plateaus result from a
curse of dimensionality, and that current approaches for solving them end up
encoding the problem into some small, classically simulable, subspaces. Thus,
while stressing quantum computers can be essential for collecting data, our
analysis sheds serious doubt on the non-classicality of the information
processing capabilities of parametrized quantum circuits for barren
plateau-free landscapes. We end by discussing caveats in our arguments, the
role of smart initializations and the possibility of provably superpolynomial,

present a first step in achieving error correction at the level of quantum
algorithms by combining a unified perspective on modern quantum algorithms via
quantum signal processing (QSP). An error model of under- or over-rotation of

It is shown that while Pauli $Z$-errors are not recoverable without additional

appending a noisy `recovery QSP.' Furthermore, it is found that a recovery QSP
of length $O(2^k c^{k^2} d)$ is sufficient to correct any length-$d$ QSP with
$c$ unique phases to $k^{th}$-order in error $\epsilon$. Allowing an additional
assumption, a lower bound of $\Omega(cd)$ is shown, which is tight for $k = 1$,

central importance in quantum science and engineering. For example, it enables

natural language processing (QNLP), and do so in quantum computer scientist
friendly terms. We opted for an expository presentation style, and provide
references for supporting empirical evidence and formal statements concerning
mathematical generality.
  We recall how the quantum model for natural language that we employ
canonically combines linguistic meanings with rich linguistic structure, most
notably grammar. In particular, the fact that it takes a quantum-like model to
combine meaning and structure, establishes QNLP as quantum-native, on par with
simulation of quantum systems. Moreover, the now leading Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) paradigm for encoding classical data on
quantum hardware, variational quantum circuits, makes NISQ exceptionally
QNLP-friendly: linguistic structure can be encoded as a free lunch, in contrast
to the apparently exponentially expensive classical encoding of grammar.
  Quantum speed-up for QNLP tasks has already been established in previous work
with Will Zeng. Here we provide a broader range of tasks which all enjoy the
same advantage.
  Diagrammatic reasoning is at the heart of QNLP. Firstly, the quantum model
interprets language as quantum processes via the diagrammatic formalism of
categorical quantum mechanics. Secondly, these diagrams are via ZX-calculus
translated into quantum circuits. Parameterisations of meanings then become the
circuit variables to be learned.
  Our encoding of linguistic structure within quantum circuits also embodies a
novel approach for establishing word-meanings that goes beyond the current

the minimum quantum of energy in the universe corresponds today to a
temperature of 10^(-29) degrees K, probably forming a cosmic background of a
Bose condensate [1]. Then, the bit with minimum energy today in the Universe is
a quantum of energy 10^(-45)ergs, with an equivalent mass of 10^(-66)g. Low
temperature implies low energy per bit and, of course, this is the way for

arises in certain physical systems for quantum computing, such as photonics.
FBQC can offer significant architectural simplifications, enabling hardware
made up of many identical modules, requiring an extremely low depth of
operations on each physical qubit and reducing classical processing
requirements. We present two pedagogical examples of fault-tolerant schemes
constructed in this framework and numerically evaluate their threshold under a
hardware agnostic fusion error model including both erasure and Pauli error. We
also study an error model of linear optical quantum computing with
probabilistic fusion and photon loss. In FBQC the non-determinism of fusion is
directly dealt with by the quantum error correction protocol, along with other
errors. We find that tailoring the fault-tolerance framework to the physical

Using the Heisenberg picture, it is proposed that detecting relative phases or entanglement between two charges in an interference experiment is equivalent to accessing empirically the gauge degrees of freedom associated with the so‐called ghost (scalar) modes of the field in the Lorenz gauge. These results imply that ghost modes are measurable and hence physically relevant, contrary to what is usually thought. They also raise interesting questions about the relation between the principle of locality and the principle of gauge‐invariance.

decision diagrams which provides an efficient data structure for various

               Quantum computing devices are inevitably subject to errors. To leverage quantum technologies for computational benefits in practical applications, quantum algorithms and protocols must be implemented reliably under noise and imperfections. Since noise and imperfections limit the size of quantum circuits that can be realized on a quantum device, developing quantum error mitigation techniques that do not require extra qubits and gates is of critical importance. In this work, we present a deep learning-based protocol for reducing readout errors on quantum hardware. Our technique is based on training an artificial neural network (NN) with the measurement results obtained from experiments with simple quantum circuits consisting of singe-qubit gates only. With the NN and deep learning, non-linear noise can be corrected, which is not possible with the existing linear inversion methods. The advantage of our method against the existing methods is demonstrated through quantum readout error mitigation experiments performed on IBM five-qubit quantum devices.","Jihye Kim, Byungdu Oh, Yonuk Chong, Euyheon Hwang, Daniel K Park",New Journal of Physics,,"quantum_readout_error_mitigation kim euyheon_hwang daniel_k_park quantum readout error mitigation via deep learning - jihye , byungdu oh , yonuk chong , euyheon hwang , and daniel k park"

repeater networks have provided extremely valuable benchmarks for assessing
near-term quantum communication protocols. However, these bounds are usually
derived in the limit of ideal devices and leave questions about the performance
of practical implementations unanswered. To address this challenge, we quantify
how the presence of loss in repeater stations affect the maximum attainable
rates for quantum communication over linear repeater chains and more complex
quantum networks. Extending the framework of node splitting, we model the loss
introduced at the repeater stations and then prove the corresponding limits. In
the linear chain scenario we show that, by increasing the number of repeater
stations, the maximum rate cannot overcome a quantity which solely depends on
the loss of a single station. We introduce a way of adapting the standard
machinery for obtaining bounds to this realistic scenario. The difference is
that whilst ultimate limits for any strategy can be derived given a fixed
channel, when the repeaters introduce additional decoherence, then the
effective overall channel is itself a function of the chosen repeater strategy
(e.g., one-way versus two-way classical communication). Classes of repeater
strategies can be analysed using additional modelling and the subsequent bounds
can be interpreted as the optimal rate within that class.","Riccardo Laurenza, Nathan Walk, Jens Eisert, Stefano Pirandola",arXiv,quant-ph,"jens_eisert rate limits in_quantum networks with lossy repeaters - riccardo laurenza , nathan walk , jens eisert and stefao pirandola"
Real-time quantum error correction beyond break-even,https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09116,Quantum Error Correction,Real-time quantum error correction beyond break-even,"The ambition of harnessing the quantum for computation is at odds with the
fundamental phenomenon of decoherence. The purpose of quantum error correction
(QEC) is to counteract the natural tendency of a complex system to decohere.
This cooperative process, which requires participation of multiple quantum and
classical components, creates a special type of dissipation that removes the
entropy caused by the errors faster than the rate at which these errors corrupt
the stored quantum information. Previous experimental attempts to engineer such
a process faced an excessive generation of errors that overwhelmed the
error-correcting capability of the process itself. Whether it is practically
possible to utilize QEC for extending quantum coherence thus remains an open
question. We answer it by demonstrating a fully stabilized and error-corrected
logical qubit whose quantum coherence is significantly longer than that of all
the imperfect quantum components involved in the QEC process, beating the best
of them with a coherence gain of $G = 2.27 \pm 0.07$. We achieve this

purification and a quantum memory it constitutes a so-called quantum repeater.

(VQOL), that may be used for designing and executing realistic simulations of
quantum optics experiments. A graphical user interface allows one to rapidly
build and configure a variety of different optical experiments, while the
runtime environment provides unique capabilities for visualization and
analysis. All standard linear optical components are available as well as
sources of thermal, coherent, and entangled Gaussian states. A unique aspect of
VQOL is the introduction of non-Gaussian measurements using detectors modeled
as deterministic devices that ""click"" when the amplitude of the light falls
above a given threshold. We describe the underlying theoretical models and
provide several illustrative examples. We find that VQOL provides a a faithful
representation of many experimental quantum optics phenomena and may serve as
both a useful instructional tool for students as well as a valuable research
tool for practitioners.","Brian R. La Cour, Maria Maynard, Parth Shroff, Gabriel Ko, Evan Ellis",arXiv,quant-ph,"la_cour maria_maynard gabriel_ko evan_ellis the_virtual_quantum_optics_laboratory - brian r. la cour , maria maynard , parth shroff , gabriel ko , evan ellis"
The information-theoretic foundation of thermodynamic work extraction,https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04588,Physical Information,The information-theoretic foundation of thermodynamic work extraction,"In this paper I apply newly-proposed information-theoretic principles to
thermodynamic work extraction. I show that if it is possible to extract work
deterministically from a physical system prepared in any one of a set of
states, then those states must be distinguishable from one another. This result
is formulated independently of scale and of particular dynamical laws; it also
provides a novel connection between thermodynamics and information theory,
established via the law of conservation of energy (rather than the second law
of thermodynamics). Albeit compatible with these conclusions, existing
thermodynamics approaches cannot provide a result of such generality, because
they are scale-dependent (relying on ensembles or coarse-graining) or tied to
particular dynamical laws. This paper thus provides a broader foundation for
thermodynamics, with implications for the theory of von Neumann's universal
constructor",Chiara Marletto,arXiv,"quant-ph, physics.comp-ph",the information - theoretic foundation of thermodynamic work extraction

of quantum thermodynamics; rather, it is a convenient entry point for the

  photonic interfaces","Generating entanglement between distant quantum systems is at the core of
quantum networking. In recent years, numerous theoretical protocols for remote
entanglement generation have been proposed, of which many have been
experimentally realized. Here, we provide a modular theoretical framework to
elucidate the general mechanisms of photon-mediated entanglement generation
between single spins in atomic or solid-state systems. Our framework
categorizes existing protocols at various levels of abstraction and allows for
combining the elements of different schemes in new ways. These abstraction
layers make it possible to readily compare protocols for different quantum
hardware. To enable the practical evaluation of protocols tailored to specific
experimental parameters, we have devised numerical simulations based on the
framework with our codes available online.","Hans K. C. Beukers, Matteo Pasini, Hyeongrak Choi, Dirk Englund, Ronald Hanson, Johannes Borregaard",arXiv,quant-ph,"tutorial : remote entanglement protocols for stationary qubits with photonic interfaces - hans k.c . beukers , ."

beginning of a new quantum era. Indeed, two-photon interference has no
classical analogue, giving it a distinct advantage for a range of applications.
The peculiarities of quantum physics may now be used to our advantage to
outperform classical computations, securely communicate information, simulate
highly complex physical systems and increase the sensitivity of precise
measurements. This separation from classical to quantum physics has motivated
physicists to study two-particle interference for both fermionic and bosonic
quantum objects. So far, two-particle interference has been observed with
massive particles, among others, such as electrons and atoms, in addition to
plasmons, demonstrating the extent of this effect to larger and more complex
quantum systems. A wide array of novel applications to this quantum effect is
to be expected in the future. This review will thus cover the progress and
applications of two-photon (two-particle) interference over the last three
decades.","FrédÉric Bouchard, Alicia Sit, Yingwen Zhang, Robert Fickler, Filippo M.

it can be computed is a practical question with little further philosophical
importance. In this essay, I offer a detailed case that one would be wrong. In
particular, I argue that computational complexity theory -- the field that
studies the resources (such as time, space, and randomness) needed to solve
computational problems -- leads to new perspectives on the nature of
mathematical knowledge, the strong AI debate, computationalism, the problem of
logical omniscience, Hume's problem of induction, Goodman's grue riddle, the
foundations of quantum mechanics, economic rationality, closed timelike curves,
